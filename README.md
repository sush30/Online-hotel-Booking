# Online-hotel-Booking
We can book hotels online and cancel the bookings online

The controller is in \BookHotel\src\main\java\com\example\demo folder and model is also present there.
The database used is H2 so that you can run the code and just copy the link provided in application.properties to view the database.
The view files are jsp and is present in \BookHotel\src\main\webapp folder.
Currently, I am able to fetch the list of hotels based on their location from the database and anyone could go to the view page for booking the hotel.
I am currently trying to impelemnet session in my code.
I will update readme as soon as I will make any progress.
